# MemoLab Beer Space
A quick analysis of the [MemoLab](http://www.thememolab.org/) members' beer preferences using the [Hypertools package](https://hypertools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), based on a [similar analysis](https://github.com/andrewheusser/beer-space) conducted by [Andy Heusser](https://github.com/andrewheusser).

One night we gathered together, drank some beers, and rated each beer on different attributes...for science!

The beers we drank:
- Anderson Valley G&T Gose
- Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA
- Dogfish Head Flesh & Blood IPA

- Jack's Abbey Copper Legend
- Alltech Lexington Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Stout
- Lamplighter Rabbit Rabbit

The beer attributes for rating:
- Can Appearance
- Beer Appearance
- Aroma
- Mouth Feel
